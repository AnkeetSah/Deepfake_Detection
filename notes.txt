How __name__ Helps Flask:
In Flask, __name__ plays a crucial role in locating the main entry file and determining the relative paths for templates and static files.

Hereâ€™s why it matters:
__name__ tells Flask the location of the current file. This helps Flask know where the starting point of the app is.
Flask uses this information to set up the app's root directory and locate the necessary resources (like templates, static files, etc.).

Why __name__:
__name__ is a special variable that holds the name of the module currently being executed.
Flask uses it to determine the location of the app and locate other resources like templates and static files.

Flask uses __name__ to determine:

The location of the app file (app.py in your case).
Where to find static files and templates, which are typically stored in separate folders.
Templates are typically stored in a templates/ folder (e.g., index.html files).
Static files like CSS and JavaScript are stored in a static/ folder (e.g., style.css).




@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Welcome to the Deepfake Detection App!"
@app.route('/'): This is a route decorator that maps a specific URL (/) to a function.
Root URL (/): Refers to the homepage.
def home():: Defines a function home that handles requests sent to the root URL.
return statement: The text "Welcome to the Deepfake Detection App!" is returned directly as a response to the web browser.



if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
if __name__ == "__main__":
Ensures the code runs only when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.
app.run(debug=True)
Starts the Flask development server.
debug=True:
Enables the debug mode, allowing the app to automatically restart upon code changes.
Displays detailed error messages in the browser for easier debugging.
